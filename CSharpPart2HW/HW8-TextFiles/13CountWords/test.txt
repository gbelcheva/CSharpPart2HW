Join us in celebrating the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope's 25th anniversary!
The Ode to Hubble competition needs your inspiration - express your feelings or share your ideas about Hubble - and as long as it can be uploaded as a YouTube, Vine and Instagram video less than 3 minutes long you can submit anything.
Pan over a drawing, write a poem, film your own Hubblecast, sing a song, make an animation or compose a piece of music and upload it: just make it creative and, most of all, inspired by Hubble, or one of its great discoveries or images.
